# What is leano?

Elevator pitch:

 **For** agile development teams, **who** are working with kanban based lean task management systems **the** leano kanban
 is a lean kanban project manager, **that** adds iteration overviews and the possibility to export task information for 
 changelog integration during development.

 **Unlike** other kanban based products, **who** only give the opportunity to manage a kanban board **our product** gives stake
 holder and customer roles the opportunity to review each iteration's progress, without digging too deep into
 task management itself, leaving the development team the freedom to exercise control over the technical decisions
 for a project. It also helps the development team to become more accountable, by exposing the entire task
 management through a feed, that CI solutions can consume and integrate into the development versions of the
 product so the end users can review what features were integrated into every current version.

# Benefits

* Never deal with stuff You don't have to care about anymore.
