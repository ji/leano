== What is leano?

Elevator pitch:

 FOR agile development teams, WHO are working with kanban based lean task management systems THE leano kanban
 is a lean kanban project manager, THAT adds iteration overviews and the possibility to export task information for 
 changelog integration during development.

 UNLIKE other kanban based products, WHO only give the opportunity to manage a kanban board OUR PRODUCT gives stake
 holder and customer roles the opportunity to review each iteration's progress, without digging too deep into
 task management itself, leaving the development team the freedom to exercise control over the technical decisions
 for a project. It also helps the development team to become more accountable, by exposing the entire task
 management through a feed, that CI solutions can consume and integrate into the development versions of the
 product so the end users can review what features were integrated into every current version.
